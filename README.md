Image-Based Detection of Quality of Fruits and Vegetables Using AI.

Developed an AI-driven system using computer vision techniques.

Utilized YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 computer vision models for real-time classification.

The system detects healthy and rotten fruits and vegetables.

Automated the quality assurance process to reduce human error.

Enhanced efficiency in the agricultural industry.

Utilized the system to assist in winemaking processes based on the percentage of rotten produce.
